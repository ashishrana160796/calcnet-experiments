# Repository Description

This repository contains experimental setup for experiments conducted in 'Exploring numerical cxploration with CalcNet' paper
that was published in ICTAI 2019. It was a submission under short paper categories involving new research ideas anc concepts
that are under development.
 
 # Motivation and Objective of Research
 
 The motivation behind this research is developing neural network architecture that learns fundamentally
 "how to compute a numerical expression ?" meaning it holds the capability to predict for unseen higher range data.
The idea is to input an equation, parse it and then use neural network modules evaluate
the expression under specific degree of certainity. Objective of this research is to being able to solve quantum mechanics equations
like _Heisenberg's uncertainty equation_ with neural networks architecture like these and
introduce neural networks as a assisting mean for equations that already involve uncertainity in them. Hence, this neural network
solves the mathematical equations involving fuzziness in them.
