# Experiment Description & Setup

In this section the parser and calcnet effective architecture is coded. 

__Note:__ The experimental setup doesn't exactly match with the one used in paper. For replication of results remove the negative train targets from the generated data for improved results.

# Usage Instructions

* Simply, run the script with following command on your linux machine `python3 script_name.py`.
* Also, for running the jupyter notebook just start the jupyter server in the given directory and use the generated history variables to observe the plots for different models during different epoch trainings.

# Content

* `parser-util.py`: A sample parser utility script that is present to generate data and simulate actual calculations for expression
   evaluation for calcnet for experimentation.
